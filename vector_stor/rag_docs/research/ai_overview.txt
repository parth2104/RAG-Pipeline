 Machine Learning Fundamentals
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn 
    and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main 
    types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement 
    learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised 
    learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning learns through 
    interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.

    Deep Learning and Neural Networks
    
    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. 
    These networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected 
    nodes. Deep learning has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language 
    processing, and speech recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly 
    effective for image processing, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers 
    excel at sequential data processing.

    Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    
    NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. 
    Key tasks in NLP include text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, 
    machine translation, and question answering. Modern NLP heavily relies on transformer 
    architectures like BERT, GPT, and T5. These models use attention mechanisms to understand 
    context and relationships between words in text.
